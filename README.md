ofxVibe
=====================================

This OpenFrameworks addon implements the [ViBe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViBe) background subtraction algorithm.
My code was heavily inspired by [Sergei Belousov](https://github.com/BelBES), so I'd like to credit [his work](https://github.com/BelBES/VIBE).


Licence

ViBe is patented: in order to use it in any commercial content you should [ask for licensing](http://www.vibeinmotion.com/Licensing.aspx).

I have no relationship with the patent holders and the code presented here is just an experiment to better understand the algorithm and to evaluate its performance.
